I needed something to do in my free time the end goal is to try and attempt to see if it's possible to improve programmatic revenue 

- Adjust the bid dynamically to 1 cent above the required price
- Calculates savings and ensures a portion goes back into media costs (which get absorbed by DSPs) 
- Updates Google Ad Manager's Unified Pricing Rules (UPRs) dynamically
